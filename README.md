# 🥔 Potato Disease Detection using CNN & Flask

A **Deep Learning–based web application** that detects potato leaf diseases using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**.  
Users can upload a potato leaf image, and the system predicts whether the leaf is **Healthy**, affected by **Early Blight**, or **Late Blight**.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Potato diseases cause major crop losses if not detected early.  
This project uses **TensorFlow (Keras)** to train a CNN model and **Flask** to deploy the model as a web application for real-time disease prediction.
